      <p>I value good design and good engineering on the web. Each relies on the other, and I have spent
        a lot of time learning to both well.</p>

      <h2>I use the latest web technologies to produce high-performance, responsive 
        websites.  Here is some filler text for equivalent word counts.</h2>
      <p>I have spent time learning the prominent languages, technologies, and techniques used in front-end development.  I am skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I have also spent time learning advanced front-end web development, such as front-end template systems, client-side JavaScript applications, and CSS preprocessing.  I have built custom themes with WordPress – of which this portfolio is an example.</p>
      <p>Although I've so far had limited experience developing websites and applications with other developers, I try to have the self-discipline to use techniques in my development process that would make teamwork possible.  I do my best to write clear, concise, and richly annotated code that can be understood by another developer.  I've spent too much time reading JavaScript style guides.  I run test suites to monitor for bugs, and I try to use version control.</p>
      <!-- <p>I try not to re-invent the wheel, when possible.  I've made good use of many of the open source libraries and frameworks that other developers have built.  In the future, I hope to make my own contributions to these projects.</p> -->
